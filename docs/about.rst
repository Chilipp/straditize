Why straditize?
---------------
In an age of digital data analysis, gaining access to data from the pre-digital
era – or any data that is only available as a figure on a page – remains a
problem and an under-utilized scientific resource. Whilst there are numerous
programs available that allow the digitization of scientific data in a simple
x-y graph format, we know of no semi-automated program that can deal with data
plotted with multiple horizontal axes that share the same vertical axis, such
as pollen diagrams and other stratigraphic figures that are common in the Earth
sciences. STRADITIZE (Stratigraphic Diagram Digitizer) is a new open-source
program that allows stratigraphic figures to be digitized in a single semi-
automated operation. It is designed to detect multiple plots of variables
analyzed along the same vertical axis, whether this is a sediment core or any
similar depth/time series.


About the author
----------------
The code and GUI of straditize was developed by Philipp S. Sommer at the
Institute of Earth System Dynamics (IDYST) at the University of Lausanne as
part of the SNF funded HORNET_ Project (200021_169598).

The other contributors are `Basil A. S. Davis`_, `Manuel Chevalier`_ and
Dilan Rech who made significant contributions to the layout, workflow, beta
tests and and reviewing of the software.
