Installation
============

How to install
--------------
You can either install straditize through a package manager such as
:ref:`conda <install-conda>` or :ref:`pip <install-pip>` or install it
:ref:`from source <install-source>`.

.. _install-conda:

Installation using conda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We highly recommend to use conda_ for installing straditize. Here you can
install it via manually via the `chilipp channel`_

After having downloaded and installed  anaconda_, open a terminal (or the
*Anaconda Prompt* on windows) and add the `conda-forge channel`_ to your
default conda-channels via::

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge

Then you can choose. We recommend to install straditize into its own environment via::

    $ conda create -n straditize -c chilipp straditize

and then activate this environment via::

    $ conda activate straditize

In that way you do not mess up your base environment. Nevertheless you can also install it into an existing environment via::

    $ conda install -c chilipp straditize

In the same terminal, now type ``straditize`` to start the software.

.. note::

    The latest master branch on github is always available under the ``master``
    label on the `chilipp channel`_. Just type::

        $ conda install -c chilipp/label/master straditize

    to install the latest version from the master branch.

.. _install-pip:

Installation using pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you do not want to use conda for managing your python packages and already
have python3 installed on your computer, you can also
use the python package manager ``pip``. To be on the safe side, make sure you
have the :ref:`dependencies` installed. If so, open a terminal and install it
via::

    $ pip install straditize

To open the software, type ``straditize`` in the same terminal.

.. _install-source:

Installation from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To install it from source, make sure you have the :ref:`dependencies`
installed. Download (or clone) the github_ repository, e.g. via::

    git clone https://github.com/Chilipp/straditize.git

and install it via::

    pip install .  # or python setup.py install, but pip is recommended

from your terminal. To open the software, type ``straditize`` in the same
terminal.

.. _dependencies:

Dependencies
------------
Required dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
straditize has been tested for python>=3.6. Furthermore the
package is built upon multiple other packages, mainly

- :ref:`psyplot-gui <psyplot_gui:psyplot-gui>`>1.2.0: The graphical user
  interface for psyplot
- PyQt5_: Pythons Qt bindings that are required by psyplot-gui (note that
  PyQt4 is **not** supported!)
- `numpy, scipy`_ and pandas_: for the data management and compuations
- matplotlib_>=2.0: **The** python visualiation package
- pillow_: for reading and writing images
- scikit-image_: For image recognition features
- openpyxl_: For exports to Excel files
- netCDF4_: A library for saving and storing netCDF files.


.. _optional_deps:

Optional dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We furthermore recommend to use

- tesserocr_: for column names recognition. It depends on the tesseract_ OCR
  and you can install both (on Linux and MacOS) via::

      $ conda install -c chilipp tesserocr

  (see :ref:`colnames-ocr` for more information)

Running the tests
-----------------
We use pytest_ to run our tests. So you can either run clone out the github_
repository and run::

    $ python setup.py test

or install pytest_ by yourself and run

    $ py.test

Alternatively you can build the recipe in the `conda-recipe` directory via

    $ conda build conda-recipe

which will also run the test suite.

.. warning::

    Running the entire test suite in one single process (such as ``python setup.py test``) might be quite memory consumptive because it involves the creation and closing of many PyQt widgets and unfortunately some memory is leaked from one test to another. Therefore we recommend to split the tests into multiple processes, e.g.::

        # run the test suite but ignore some modules
        python setup.py test -a '--ignore=tests/widgets/test_selection_toolbar.py --ignore=tests/widgets/test_samples_table.py --ignore=tests/widgets/test_beginner.py --ignore=tests/widgets/test_hoya_del_castillo.py'
        # run the tests for the previously ignored modules
        python setup.py test -a 'tests/widgets/test_selection_toolbar.py
        tests/widgets/test_samples_table.py'
        python setup.py test -a 'tests/widgets/test_beginner.py'
        python setup.py test -a 'tests/widgets/test_hoya_del_castillo.py'

    or equivalently with `py.test` instead of `python setup.py test -a`. Note that `conda build conda-recipe` already splits the session into multiple processes.

    Nevertheless, you should expect about ~180 tests to be ran and a total memory usage of about 3 to 4GB RAM.


Building the docs
-----------------
The online documentation is accessible as PDF, HTML and Epub under
https://straditize.readthedocs.io or https://straditize.rtfd.io. Thanks to the
free services by `readthedocs.org <https://readthedocs.org/>`__, the online
documentation is build automatically after each commit to the github_
repository.

To build the docs locally on your machine, check out the github_ repository and
install the requirements in ``'docs/environment.yml'`` and the
sphinx_rtd_theme_ package. The easiest way to do this is via anaconda by
typing::

    $ conda env create -f docs/environment.yml
    $ conda activate straditize_docs
    $ conda install sphinx_rtd_theme

Then build the docs via::

    $ cd docs
    $ make html  # or `make pdf` for a PDF version compiled with Latex

.. _github: https://github.com/Chilipp/straditize
.. _pytest: https://pytest.org/latest/contents.html
.. _sphinx_rtd_theme: https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest


.. _update:

Updating straditize
-------------------

Updating the software depends on how you installed it on your system.

.. _update-conda:

Updating via conda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you installed straditize via conda (see :ref:`install-conda`), you can
update it via::

    $ conda update -c chilipp straditize

.. _update-pip:

Updating via pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you installed it via ``pip`` (see :ref:`install-pip`), you can update it
via::

    $ pip install -U straditize

.. _update-source:

Updating from source files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you installed it via ``python setup.py install`` from the source repository
(see :ref:`install-source`), just run that command again after having checked
out the latest version from github.


.. _uninstall:

Uninstallation
--------------
The uninstallation depends on the system you used to install straditize. Either
you did it via :ref:`conda <install-conda>` (see :ref:`uninstall-conda`), via
:ref:`pip <install-pip>` or from the
:ref:`source files <install-source>` (see :ref:`uninstall-pip`).

Anyway, if you may want to remove the psyplot configuration files. If you did
not specify anything else (see :func:`psyplot.config.rcsetup.psyplot_fname`),
the configuration files for psyplot are located in the user home directory.
Under linux and OSX, this is ``$HOME/.config/psyplot``. On other platforms it
is in the ``.psyplot`` directory in the user home.

.. _uninstall-conda:

Uninstallation via conda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you installed straditize via :ref:`conda <install-conda>`, simply run::

    conda uninstall straditize

.. _uninstall-pip:

Uninstallation via pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Uninstalling via pip simply goes via::

    pip uninstall straditize

Note, however, that you should use :ref:`conda <uninstall-conda>` if you also
installed it via conda.
