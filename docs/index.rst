STRADITIZE (Stratigraphic Diagram Digitizer) is an open-source program that
allows stratigraphic figures to be digitized in a single semi-automated
operation. It is designed to detect multiple plots of variables analyzed along
the same vertical axis, whether this is a sediment core or any similar
depth/time series.

Usually, in an age of digital data analysis, gaining access to data from the
pre-digital era – or any data that is only available as a figure on a page –
remains a problem and an under-utilized scientific resource.

This program tackles this problem by providing a python package to digitize
especially pollen diagrams, but also any other type of stratigraphic diagram.

The package is very new and there are many features that will be included in
the future. Therefore we would be very pleased to get feedback! To do so, you
can contact us or raise an issue on
`GitHub <https://github.com/Chilipp/straditize>`__.
