Measurements
============
Measurements are the source data that has been used to create the diagram
(see :ref:`terminology`). The crucial part after the digitization of a
diagram is to find out, where these measurements exactly are.

Straditize assists you with this through automatic measurement finding
algorithms, or you can load the measurement locations from an external files
or you just add and edit the measurements manually.
