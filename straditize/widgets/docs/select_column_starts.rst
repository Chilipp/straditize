=================================
A pollen diagram is defined through different columns, each column
represents one taxa, species, PFT, etc.. To digitize the data, we have to know,
where each column starts exactly.

Press the :kbd:`Shift` button and left-click on the plot to create a new
vertical mark. Left-click the mark and drag it to the start of one column.

Right-click a mark to delete it.
