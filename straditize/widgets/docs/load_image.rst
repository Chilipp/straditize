Load a diagram
==============
The first step is to load the picture of your diagram.

1. If you are starting straditize from the psyplot GUI (i.e. not via typing
   ``straditize`` in the terminal or through the app), you should first switch
   to the straditizer layout via

   :menuselection:`Windows --> Window layouts --> Straditizer layout`.

   .. image:: straditizer-layout.png
       :width: 100%

   This will show you the straditizer control panel.

2. To load the picture of your diagram, select

   :menuselection:`File --> Open project --> Open straditizer --> Project or image`

   .. image:: load-image.png
       :width: 100%

   and select the image file you want to load.

   .. only:: html

       Alternatively, you can use the use the :kbd:`Control-O` (:kbd:`âŒ˜-O` on
       MacOS) keyboard shortcut or the |arrow| button at the top of the
       straditizer control.

   .. only:: not html

       Alternatively, you can use the :kbd:`Control-O` (:kbd:`Command-O` on
       MacOS) keyboard shortcut or the |arrow| button at the top of the
       straditizer control.
