Samples
=======
samples are the source data that has been used to create the diagram
(see :ref:`terminology`). The crucial part after the digitization of a
diagram is to find out, where these samples exactly are.

Straditize assists you with this through automatic sample finding
algorithms, or you can load the sample locations from an external files
or you just add and edit the samples manually.
