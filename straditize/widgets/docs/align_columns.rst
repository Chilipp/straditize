.. _align-cols:

Align the columns vertically
============================
Sometimes the columns are not aligned properly which makes it hard to identify
where the exact sample is located and might lead to misinterpretations
of samples. To correct this, we implemented a methodology to align the
columns.

After having clicked the :guilabel:`Align columns` button, multiple marks are
created. To correct the vertical displacement, move those marks to the vertical
position in each column, that should be on the same vertical level.

You can select the horizontal lines for moving multiple marks and the vertical
line for selecting only one mark.

1. Select one mark on one column by clicking on it's vertical line

2. Move the mark vertically (the horizontal line does not matter)

3. Select another mark of another column

4. Move this mark to a point that should have the same y-value as the first
   mark

5. Click the :guilabel:`Apply` button
