Align the columns vertically
============================
Sometimes the columns are not aligned properly which makes it hard to identify
where the exact measurement is located and might lead to misinterpretations
of measurements.

To correct this, move the marks for each column to the vertical positions that
should have the same y-value for each column.

Click the horizontal line for selecting multiple marks, click the vertical line
for selecting only one mark.

1. Select one mark on one column by clicking on it's vertical line

2. Move the mark vertically (the horizontal line does not matter)

3. Select another mark of another column

4. Move this mark to a point that should have the same y-value as the first
   mark

5. Click the :guilabel:`Apply` button
