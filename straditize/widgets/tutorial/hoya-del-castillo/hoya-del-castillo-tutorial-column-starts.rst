Selecting the columns
=====================
The next step is, to automatically separate the columns from each other. This
is simple in our case, since straditize can separate them automatically.

1. Click the :guilabel:`Column starts` button. You will see several vertical
   blue lines appearing on the plot that you can drag and drop such as you did
   it when selecting the diagram part. You can change their colors using the
   :ref:`marker control <marker-control>`
2. In our case, straditize recognizes these columns automatically, so just hit
   the :guilabel:`Apply` button and you are done.
