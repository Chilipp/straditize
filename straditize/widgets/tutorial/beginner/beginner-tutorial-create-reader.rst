Create the diagram reader
=========================
Now you have to select, which type of diagram you are digitizing. In our case,
it's an area diagram which is already selected in the dropdown menu next to the
:guilabel:`Select data part` button.

So just click the :guilabel:`Convert image` button and you are ready to go for
the digitization.
