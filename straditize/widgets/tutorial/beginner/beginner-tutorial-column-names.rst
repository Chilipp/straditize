Column names
============
Finally, we select the column titles and save them in the project.

Each of the sub diagrams has a title, in our case, *Pinus*, *Juniperus*,
*Quercus ilex-type* and *Chenopodiaceae*. These names should be used in the
final digitization result and therefore you can include them in straditize:

1. Expand the `Column names` item in the straditizer control and click the
   :guilabel:`Edit column names` button
2. In the appearing widget, the colnames editor

   .. image:: tutorial-colnames-editor.png
       :alt: column names editor

   you find a table where you can edit the column names. The plot on it's left
   also shows a rotated version of the diagram, to help you identifying the
   column names. You can navigate in this plot using leftclick and zoom in and
   out using right-click (see
   `matplotlibs docs on interactive navigation with the Pan/Zoom-tool`_).

   .. hint::

       If you have tesserocr installed (see the :ref:`user manual <colnames>`),
       you can also just click the :guilabel:`Find column names` button and you
       are done.
3. When you entered the correct names in the table (see image below), click the
   :guilabel:`Edit column names` button again to hide the dialog.
