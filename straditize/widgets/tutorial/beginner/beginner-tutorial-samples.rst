Finding and editing samples
===========================
So far, we have one data point per pixel in the image. However, we have to
identify the locations of the samples in order to reproduce the original data.

Straditize assists you with this through automatic sample finding
algorithms, or you can load the sample locations from an external files
or you just add and edit the samples manually.

1. Expand the `Samples` item in the digitization control
2. Find the samples by clicking the :guilabel:`Find samples` button. straditize
   now identified the sample locations based on the extrema in the columns
   (see :ref:`find-samples` for an explanation of the algorithms).
3. To visualize the samples, you can again use the items in the `Plot control`
   tab. However, you can (and should!) also edit them by clicking the
   :guilabel:`Edit samples` button.
4. Now you see one horizontal line per sample that you can drag around
   (left-click), delete (right-click) or you can also add new samples
   (Shift + left-click). See the :ref:`edit-samples` section for more details.
5. Finally, click the :guilabel:`Apply` button or the :guilabel:`Cancel`
   button to stop the editing of the samples.

You're almost done! Your diagram is now digitized and the data could already
be exported.
