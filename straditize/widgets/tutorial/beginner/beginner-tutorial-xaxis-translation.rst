Translating the x-axis
======================
As we did for the y-axes, we do it for the x-axes.

1. Click the :guilabel:`Insert X-axis values` button in the `Axes translations`
   section of the straditizer control
2. A small dialog will appear where you should enter the value at the column
   start (in our case, 0)
3. Shift-leftclick on the plot to enter another x-value.

4. A small dialog will appear where you should enter the x-value to use

5. Click the :guilabel:`Apply` button at the bottom of the straditizer control
   when you are done.
