Digitizing the data
===================
The next step, after we cleaned up the image, is the digitization of the
diagram. Click the :guilabel:`Digitize` button.

You now see the lines that result from the digitization. You can remove them
in the `Plot control` section by clicking the |remove| button of the
*Full digitized data* row.
