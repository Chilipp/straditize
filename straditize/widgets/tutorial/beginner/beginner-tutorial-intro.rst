Beginners tutorial to introduce straditize
==========================================

.. image:: beginner-tutorial.png

In this tutorial, we digitize a simple small pollen diagram a subset of the
Hoya del Castillo dataset from [Basil2007a]_. This tutorial will introduce you
into the main parts of straditize and the basic workflow.

At the bottom of the straditizer control, you find a navigation panel which
helps you to navigate through the tutorial. Click the :guilabel:`Next` button
in this control to start the tutorial. You can skip steps by clicking the
:guilabel:`Skip` button and you can check what you have done using the
:guilabel:`Check` button and then proceed with the next step.

The tutorial will take between 5 and 10 minutes. You can save your current
state to a file using :menuselection:`File --> Save --> Save straditizer`
(see :ref:`save-and-load`) and reload it later via
:menuselection:`File --> Open project --> Open straditizer --> Project or image`
