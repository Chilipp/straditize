Translating the y-axis
======================
To correctly reproduce the diagram data, there are now only to more things to
know, that is the scaling of the y- and x-axes in the diagram.

1. Expand the `Axes translations` tab in the digitization control
2. Click the :guilabel:`Insert Y-axis values` button in the `Axes translations`
   section of the straditizer control
3. Shift-leftclick on the plot to enter the corresponding y-value.

4. A small dialog will appear where you should enter the y-value to use (in
   this case, ``300``)

5. After hitting the :guilabel:`Ok` button, you will see a mark on the plot
   (blue line). You can select the mark via leftclick and drag it to a
   different location or you can delete it via rightclick.

   - Enter the corresponding value (here ``350``)

     .. image:: select-y1_2.png

   - A new mark is created that you can modify

7. Click the :guilabel:`Apply` button at the bottom of the straditizer control
   when you are done.

    If you drag a mark and hold the :kbd:`Shift` button while releasing the
    mouse button, the dialog in point 3 from above will not pop up.
