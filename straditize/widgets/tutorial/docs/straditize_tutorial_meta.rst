Editing the meta attributes
===========================
To keep the overview on your project, you can save some meta informations
to it, for example, where you have the diagram from and what it represents.

Here for example, we know that the digitized data represents a pollen core
from *Hoya del Castillo* and has been described in detail in [Basil1980].

1. Click the :guilabel:`Attributes` button at the bottom of the straditizer
   control. You know see a table with attributes, that you can rename, delete
   and fill according to your needs.
2. Fill the data table:

   .. todo::
