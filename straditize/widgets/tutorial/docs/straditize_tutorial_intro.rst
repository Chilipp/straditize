Tutorial for digitizing a pollen diagram
========================================

.. image:: straditize-tutorial.png

In this tutorial, we digitize a stratigraphic diagram based on the data in
[Basil1980]_ and introduce to you how to extract the samples out of an area
diagram.

At the bottom of the straditizer control, you find a navigation panel which
helps you to navigate through the tutorial. Click the :guilabel:`>` button in
this control to start the tutorial. You can skip steps by clicking the
:guilabel:`Skip` button and you can check what you have done using the
:guilabel:`Check` button and then proceed with the next step.

The tutorial will take between 15 and 30 minutes. You can save your current
state to a file using :menuselection:`File --> Save --> Save straditizer`
(see :ref:`save-and-load`) and reload it later via
:menuselection:`File --> Open project --> Open straditizer --> Project or image`
