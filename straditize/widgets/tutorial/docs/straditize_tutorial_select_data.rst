Select the diagram part
=======================
The second step involves selecting the diagram part. This is the part where
your data is displayed, but without the vertical and horizontal axes or axes
descriptions.

Being exact in this step significantly reduces the later work and simplifies
the automatic digitization.

1. Click the :guilabel:`Select data part` button in the digitization control.
2. :kbd:`Shift` - leftclick on the data diagram. This will create a mark at
   your current mouse location.
3. Click on the cross to select it

4. Hold the left mouse button and drag the cross to the upper left corner of
   the diagram. Make sure you don't include the y-axis and x-axis ticks.

   You can also use the zoom and navigation tools in the figure toolbar for
   navigation.

   include the x-axis ticks (i.e. the numbers on the x-axis)
